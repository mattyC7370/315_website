		<h1>Professional Image</h1><br>
		<p>I was a Robotics Engineer Intern at a company called Joby Aviation. While I was there I put together two pieces of software. One simulated aircraft which 	<br>
		would generate and output coordinates to a udp socket, and an automatic antenna tracker to track the simulated aircraft. The first program was only for testing<br>
		purposes. I used a single-board computer called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeagleBoard">beaglebone black</a> to power the antenna tracker. The beaglebone is a linux system that allows you to control<br>
		the GPIO pins and PWM pins. These were used to send signals to the motor controllers. I used two nema stepper motors, one for pan and one for tilt. These motors<br>
		are extremely accurate and are used in most 3d printers. I used C++ to code the program. C++ allows you to use multithreading so when my antenna tracker received<br>
		a coordinate through the UDP socket it would run pan and tilt motors simultaneously. I am working with Dr. Sideris on a research project. The goal of this project<br>
		is to design and build an affordable customizable gantry-type 3D printer for large-scale concrete structural construction. I will be working with G code to run <br>
		the motors on this large scale 3D printer. This project is very interesting to me as it will be extremely useful technology for future construction projects. I will<br>
		be interning for Joby Aviation again and hope to write some of the test flight simulation software. One of my aspirations is to build or work for an electric motorcycle<br>
		company. Working with these extremely high torque electric motors is very interesting to me. Although I know nothing about battery chemistry, battery energy density <br>
		is also interesting.<br>
